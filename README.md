User has asked me to develop a password generator inside the browser, and gave me HTML, CSS, and Javascript code.
Used Javascript to make said password generator





 1. prompt user for password criteria
 a. Password length 8 < 128
 b. Lowercase, Uppercase, Number, Special characters
 2. Validate the input
3. Display password to page
These were the defining requests that were made, I added and cleaned up my own code I have added.
For loop was added to make the requests work properly.
